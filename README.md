# AAAI-7856-DATA
This is a dataset of paper 

we conduct on-site experiments in real-world scenarios to collect experimental data for validating our proposed method. By dispatching excavator machines to simulate threat scenarios, the signals collected can truly reflect the characteristics of the real site.

This is a feature dataset that integrates expert knowledge.

It is divided into two folders: one is the input folder, which includes 3000 RGB images. Each type of sample has a quantity of 1000. 

The other is the raw data-sample folder, which includes original timing signals of three consecutive defense zones.
